# Routing Program
The program aims to optimize delivery routes for three trucks and two drivers, to ensure timely delivery of 40 packages daily while adhering to specific delivery constraints. The challenge is to keep the total distance traveled by both trucks under 140 miles. This involves employing algorithms and data structures to efficiently route the trucks and distribute packages. Status and additional information is obtainable through the user interface.

# What I learned
